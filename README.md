# DJNote

A simple note taking web app built with Django.

To make a note, you first have to create a *project*.

A project is a collection of notes. You can create a project by clicking on the `+` button on the top right corner of the page.

You can then create a note by going to the project page.

## Getting started

You need to have Python 3 installed on your system.

Then install the django library:

```bash
pip install django
```

Run the server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
